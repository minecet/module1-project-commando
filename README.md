# Commando meets Mars Attacks!
# Description
  The js based game is inspried by the 80s retro game Commando that I got inspired of while trying to implement a game with moving DOM elements and while seeing the naive image croppings I got from the original game, I saw it looked like a planet surface and wanted to introduce the Mars Attacks characters as icons of the enemy and the player
# Main Functionalities
- Use the arrow keys to move the player towards the spaceship, which is the successful end of the game
- Of course, the challenge is avoiding getting shot by the randomly appearing Martians, meanwhile killing as much as you can to increase your score (+50 per each) and reaching the spaceship to pass this level
- You can shoot with the keys A-W-D-S in  a similar logic to left -up - down - right arrow keys. Meaning move as fast as you can and aim at any Martian in 90 degrees aim as fast as you can! 
- If you shoot them first, you see the Martian disappear with an effect even! If you get shot, your lives count reduces. Beware, you have only 3 of them before you reach the spaceship to escape
- Martians, aka enemies, can appear anywhere within the bounds of the screen. Keep moving, they will always target your last position
- Spaceship is located randomly on the top of the screen. If you get close by enough, it is success
# Backlog
Introducing sounds would be great to keep the player aware of being shot. Also a highlight on the lives left
Nonetheless, adding animation for the enemy shot and removing the bullet once the player got shot help a bit!
# Tech stack
HTML, CSS and JS based logic and DOM manipulation of all. Characters and bullet shootings are all image based
# States
Start screen
Game screen 
Replay options screen with the result
